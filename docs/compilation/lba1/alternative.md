# Prerequisites

-   [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) - DOS emulator which we will use
    to compile the game inside.
-   [4DOS](https://www.4dos.info/v4dos.htm#751) - Command line
    interpreter, which supports the `copy` command with binary inputs
    and output.
-   Watcom 10 compiler - For compiling C sources and running MAKEFILEs
-   MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler) 6.0 - For compiling ASM sources

# Getting prerequisites and sources

DOSBox and 4DOS are freely available. For getting Watcom 10 and MASM
6.0, you need to search the internet. Note that we did not manage to
build the game with Open Watcom. Also, for some reason the MASM version
6.11 compiler did run very slowly in the DOSBox, so it was basically
unusable. We had to use the version 6.0.

All directories and files will placed in the `~/lba-hacking` directory
on the host machine. Feel free to change this path, but then adjust the
DOSBox configuration below correspondingly. This directory will be
mounted to `C:` in DOSBox.

-   Extract 4DOS into `4dos`.
-   Extract Watcom and MASM installers into `install`. These will be
    needed to be installed.
-   Clone <https://github.com/2point21/lba1-classic-community> into
    `lba`.

The dir structure at this point should like something like this:

    ~/lba-hacking
    ├── 4dos
    ├── install
    │   ├── masm
    │   └── watcom
    └── lba

# DOSBox configuration

Change the `autoexec` section of you DOSBox configuration like below.
The configuration path of DOSBox is usually shown when you start it.
```
    [autoexec]
    mount C ~/lba-hacking

    PATH c:\watcom\binw;c:\masm\bin;%PATH%
    set INCLUDE=c:\watcom\h;c:\lba\lib386
    set WATCOM=c:\watcom
    set EDPATH=c:\watcom\eddat
    set WIPFC=c:\watcom\wipfc

    C:
    C:\4DOS\4DOS.COM
```

# Install tools

-   Launch DOSBox (e.g. with `dosbox`).
-   On the first run, 4DOS will prompt some configuration values.
-   Install Watcom by running `C:\INSTALL\WATCOM\SETUP.EXE` and
    following the instructions. Leave the default installation path
    `C:\WATCOM`. The step which proposes to modify `AUTOEXEC.EXE` and
    `CONFIG.SYS` can be skipped.
-   Install MASM by running `C:\INSTALL\MASM\DISK1\SETUP.EXE`. Leave the
    default installation paths `C:\MASM\BINB`, etc\...

Check the installation by typing in:

-   `wmake`: this should show the installed Watcom make version; in my
    case 10.5
-   `wcc386`: this should show the help of the Watcom C compiler; in my
    case 10.5
-   `ml`: this should show the version of the Microsoft Macro Assembler;
    in my case 6.00

Now we are ready to build the game.

# Build

Run inside the DOSBox
```
    cd C:\LBA\LIB386
    cd LIB_3D
    wmake
    cd ..\LIB_MENU
    wmake
    cd ..\LIB_MIDI
    wmake
    cd ..\LIB_MIX
    wmake
    cd ..\LIB_SAMP
    wmake
    cd ..\LIB_SVGA
    wmake
    cd ..\LIB_SYS
    wmake
    cd ..\..\SOURCES
    wmake
    link
```

The last command will link the `LBA0.exe`.

# Run

To run the game, you will need some assets of the original game.

-   copy HQR files,
-   copy `M_SB16.DLL`, `S3.DLL`, and `W_SB16.DLL`,
-   copy `LBA.CFG`,

into the directory containing `LBA0.exe`, in our case `C:\LBA\SOURCES`.

Run

    dos4gw LBA0.exe

Enjoy!
