{:toc}

## Notation

Opcode fields:

*char\[\]*

:   Embedded C-style (NUL-terminated) string.

*cond*

:   One or more opcodes specifying a condition.

*i16*

:   16-bit signed value (little-endian) used for opcode arguments.

*int_or_string*

:   Any of *char\[\]*, *i8*, *u8*, *i16*. This is used in conditions,
    where the type is determined by the type of the value that is being
    compared.

*pc16*

:   16-bit signed offset (little-endian) used as a jump destination,
    absolute.

*pcrel16*

:   16-bit signed offset (little-endian) used as a jump destination,
    relative to the current opcode.

*u8*

:   8-bit unsigned value used for opcode arguments.

*u16*

:   16-bit unsigned value (little-endian) used for opcode arguments.

*u32*

:   32-bit unsigned value (little-endian) used for opcode arguments.

## Life scripts

Life scripts are broken down into \"behaviours\" (\"comportement\" in
the source). Each time an actor\'s life script is executed, it executes
the same behaviour as when it last exited (or the first behaviour if it
is the first time running). This way, each behaviour acts as a mini AI
loop for the actor, with each tailored to a particular situation (e.g.
idling, with Twinsen nearby, in combat, interacting with an object,
etc).

### Life script operations

In the following table, you can see that there are a number of opcodes
that have the same behaviour but different names. This is useful when
compiling or decompiling the scripts as there is a 1:1 correspondence
between the written script and the compiled bytecode.
